## dsgn270-a3: Stephans Klassic Gaming SVG Logo

### Design Concept

#### Inspiration for my Logo

- During my search for logo, one of the designs that caught my eye was a logo of a monitor done in cool and unique ways.

  - This inspired by design in using a logo that had a clean monitor in it.
    - To accomplish a similar design to the logos I found, I created rectangle boxes and played around with different shapes that suited my needs.
  - I then used the logo I found from my search, changed the color red and added length to the cord, and put this into the monitor
  - As for the name it self. I thought of the controller as a classic gaming controller, hence the name. I also like Mortal Kombats "K" instead of "C" so I did that as well. As a result, the name "Klassic Gaming" was born
  - I like my design a lot, but going forward, I am going to play around with customzing it a lot more. I think there may be a lot to be desired.

- A problem that I faced is deleting my mockup designs before I could screencap my progress...I hope this okay to the reason I didn't include any. I would have, but i only saw the rubric after deleting them :(
